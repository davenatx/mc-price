                    <p>We met in August 2012 when we started our Master of Science in Computer Information Systems at St. Edwardâ€™s University.  Our program was cohort based and our team of six people worked together for the next 16 months to complete our degree program.  We made friendships that will last our lifetime.</p>

                    <p>We had the unique opportunity to get to know each other as friends and teammates before we started dating.  We saw how we worked individually and as a team, under stress, meeting deadlines all while working full time jobs.</p> 

                    <p>Starting out with this strong foundation of friendship and respect created the unique opportunity to build a lasting relationship. I think we both knew early in the dating phase this one was going to be different and we were going to be in this relationship for the long haul.</p>
